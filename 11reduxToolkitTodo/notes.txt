Redux ek core library hai and react-redux ek implementation hai to wire react with redux.
redux-toolkit does alot of work automatically.

- starts with store.(Usually only a single store is created, aka single source of truth.) (Exceptions are always there but only one single store is present)

- stores update the values only with the help of reducers(functions).

- Features are called as Slice(syntax)

- Slice takes name, initialState, and reducers

- reducers k andar 2 chizo ka access milta hai - state and action
  state - ke andar updated state value in the store milti hai (state ke andar multiple slices ho sakte jaise todo, authentication, etc. )
  action - action.payload (basically vo jispe kam karana hai ya kam karna hai jaise id, text, etc.)

- Dispatch - values bhejna hai
  Dispatch ke through reducer ko bhej diya

- Selector - values lena(select karna) hai, from state
